In the deep ocean there is no direct sunlight and therefore creatures cannot rely on photosynthesis to convert the Sun's energy into sugars to fuel them. Instead they use chemosynthesis to create sugars using energy released from chemical reactions occurring around the hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor.
